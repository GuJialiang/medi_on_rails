      Dr. Ava Katherine Bittner is a licensed
      Optometrist who received her Ph.D. in clinical investigation from the Johns
      Hopkins School of Public Health. She completed a clinical research postdoctoral
      fellowship at the Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute, and then
      joined the faculty as an Assistant Professor. Dr. Bittner is a recipient of the
      prestigious Ezell fellowship award from the American Academy of Optometry.
      She was also inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa national academic
      honor society for excellence in her Ph.D. thesis work, which examined the
      relationships between psychosocial factors (stress, anxiety, mood, depression)
      and day-to-day variations in vision among visually impaired patients with
      retinis pigmentosa.
      Dr. Bittner aims to extend this research to patients with glaucoma, and
      to design and conduct clinical trials involving interventions for these
      patients in the future. Her research interests also include complementary
      and alternative approaches to sight preservation and disease/symptom
      attenuation in patients with retinal degenerations, using techniques
      such as yoga, acupuncture or mindfulness-based stress reduction. Dr.
      Bittner collaborates with researchers from the Johns Hopkins Center
      for Mind-Body Research and Department of Behavioral Science on this
      multidisciplinary work.
